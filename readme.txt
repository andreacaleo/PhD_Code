This folder contains the data and code I have used during my PhD in Astrophysics at the University of Oxford. Unfortunately I have not kept the code tidy nor created a clear documentation. If downloaded onto a new machine it will not run very smoothly, especially for the material relative to papers 2 and 3. In particular, the address of the folder containing the data will in most cases be different on a different machine and so it will need to be edited by hand. It should nonetheless be possible for a dedicated researcher to make sense of it and get it to work in a reasonable amount of time.

The code refers to the papers:

A. Caleo, S. Balbus, W. J. Potter, Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, Volume 448, Issue 3, p.2077-2084
