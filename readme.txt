This folder contains the data and code I have used during my PhD in Astrophysics at the University of Oxford. Unfortunately I have not kept the code tidy nor created a clear documentation. If downloaded onto a new machine it will not run smoothly, especially for the material relative to papers 2 and 3. In particular, the address of the data will in most cases be different on a different machine and so it will need to be edited by hand. It should nonetheless be possible for a determined researcher to make sense of it and get it to work in a reasonable amount of time.
